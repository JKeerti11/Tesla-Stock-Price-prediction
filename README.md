## 🔍 Objective

To predict whether the Tesla stock price will **increase or decrease** the next day using statistical and machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- Decision Tree

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering

Derived features include:
- `open-close`: Difference between opening and closing price
- `low-high`: Intraday volatility
- `is_quarter_end`: Boolean indicating end of financial quarter
- `target`: Binary label indicating if next day’s closing price is higher

📌 Target Variable:
```text
target = 1 → Price will increase the next day  
target = 0 → Price will decrease the next day
